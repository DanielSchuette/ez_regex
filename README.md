# VisualRegex
*VisualRegex* is a JavaScript library that allows users to visually compose a regular expression by dragging and dropping building blocks like letters and numbers into place. The actually library can be found in `src`, `app` is an example website. It is similar to regex editors like [myregexp.com](http://myregexp.com/) but easier to use, especially for people without any knowledge about regular expressions.

## Dependencies
*VisualRegex* requires [SortableJS](https://github.com/SortableJS/Sortable), which is vendored in `src/dependencies`.
